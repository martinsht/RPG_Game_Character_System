I created this project to learn about inheritance in java. My superclass is Character and my subclasses are Mage, Warrior and Rogue. 
I override some of the methods in Character class in order to make them more unique for the other classes. 
I also encapsulated my program to make it more secure and practice for when my programs become more comlplicated.
